# Transvoxel tables for JavaScript

This is the data used for the [Transvoxel algorithm](https://transvoxel.org/) exposed as an npm package. All I did was take the `./Transvoxel.h` file and convert it into TypeScript.

The built package includes `esm`, `iife` and `commonjs` versions as well as type definitions.

The browser version defaults to `esm`, the Node version defaults to `commonjs`.

One performance consideration I haven't evaluated yet is whether it's better to make all of the data a single large `ArrayBuffer` instead of classes. One advantage lower level languages have that JavaScript doesn't make easy is structs and inlining. This is likely a case where you'd want to do that. But if its a problem in my usecase, I'll fix it here.

If you're running in a browser which doesn't support ESM, try using `transvoxel-iife.js`.

### Installation

yarn:

```bash
yarn add transvoxel-data
```

npm:

```bash
npm install transvoxel-data
```

### Usage

This doesn't implement the Transvoxel algorithm â€“ just the data.

Here's most of what you can `import` or `require` from `transvoxel-data`:

```ts
export declare class CellData {
  geometryCounts: number;
  vertexIndex: number[] | Uint8Array;
  vertexCount: number;
  triangleCount: number;
  constructor(geometryCounts: number, vertexIndex: Uint8Array);
  static getVertexCount(geometryCounts: number): number;
  static getTriangleCount(geometryCounts: number): number;
}
export declare class RegularCellData extends CellData {
  vertexIndex: VertexIndexList;
}
export declare class TransitionCellData extends CellData {
  vertexIndex: TransitionVertexIndexList;
}
export declare const regularCellClass: Uint8Array;
export declare const regularCellData: RegularCellData[];
export declare function getLocalIndexA(edgeCode: number): number;
export declare function getLocalIndexB(edgeCode: number): number;
export declare const regularVertexData: number[][];
export declare const transitionCellClass: number[];
export declare const transitionCornerData: number[];
export declare const transitionVertexData: number[][];
export {};
```
